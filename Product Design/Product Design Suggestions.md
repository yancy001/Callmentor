## Talent Pool Design
1. **Mentor URL Customization**:
   - Create custom URLs for mentors, e.g., `https://app.call-mentor.com/#/mentor-profile/42`.
   - Replace numbers with names for a more personalized link, e.g., use mentor's name instead of numerical ID.
2. **Session Length Flexibility**:
   - Allow session lengths to be adjustable in 5-minute increments.
   - Free consultation sessions can be as short as 15 minutes to introduce services (similar to free consultations by lawyers or accountants).
3. **Availability Management**:
   - Provide a single-page interface where mentors can manage their availability and overrides for a cleaner and more comprehensive view.
4. **Welcome Email**:
   - Send orientation emails to both mentors and mentees to guide them through the platform.
