## Research on Chinese Organizations

### Target Group:
- Exclusively Chinese students. (Other countries' students likely face similar challenges but tailored for one nationality here.)

### Services:
1. **Mentorship and Consulting**:
   - Profit from the fee gap between students and mentors/teachers.
   - Includes interview preparation, resume reviews, career planning, and sharing industry insights.

2. **Corporate Collaboration**:
   - Partnerships with small to medium-sized companies.
   - Students pay for internships, recommendation letters, etc.
   - Assistance in job placements with a refund of one year’s salary post-successful employment.

### Advantages:
1. **Large Market Potential**:
   - Access to students with significant gaps in academic and social skills.

2. **Success-Oriented Services**:
   - High probability of helping students secure internships or jobs, addressing immediate needs.

---

### Disadvantages:
1. **Limited Demographic**:
   - Exclusively targeting one nationality (Chinese students), while the job market is Canadian-centric.
   - A single-nationality brand image restricts recognition and future scalability to serve global students.

2. **Reputation Risks**:
   - Copying assignments and leaking test questions are prevalent, creating significant gray areas.
   - Lack of university recognition limits growth potential.

3. **Superficial Solutions**:
   - International students pay for internships and jobs but surrender a year’s salary post-hiring.
   - While addressing urgent needs, this approach fails to resolve fundamental issues:
     - Difficulty integrating into Canadian society.
     - Limited opportunities to expand social and professional circles.
     - Challenges in securing long-term employment and career stability.
