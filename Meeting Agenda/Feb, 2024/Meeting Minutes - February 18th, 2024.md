## Notes
- Service content should be as detailed as possible. If not feasible, provide a framework.
  - Example: A 1.5-hour mock interview could include 45 minutes of interview and 45 minutes of guidance.
- Service prices can reference average salaries for companies and positions on Glassdoor but must include distinctions:
  - **Pricing Factors**:
    - Should pricing consider service difficulty or only duration?
    - Example: For an oil company project manager with 10 years of experience earning $60/hour, the service price could be set at 1.5x the rate, i.e., $90/hour.
    - If mock interviews are harder than industry insights, mock interview pricing could be $100/hour, and industry insights $80/hour.
