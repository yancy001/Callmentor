# Meeting Summary - February 7th, 2024

## **Pitch Deck**

### Market Size
1. **Gross Sale**: $1 Billion
   - **Market Reports**:
     - Universities or research institutions purchase numerous market reports annually. Find reports that align closely with our business model for reference.
   - **Investor Preferences**:
     - Investors only consider authoritative Market Reports as they are more credible.
   - **Data from Stats Canada**:
     - Credible but too general. We need precise student market size data.
     - Determine if the market size is $1 Billion or $500 Million.
     - Mere student numbers are insufficient; projections based on headcount are not authoritative.

2. **Direct Data Needed**:
   - Number of students seeking mentors.
   - How much students are willing to pay.
   - Total market size.
   - Market reports can be found in electronic libraries of schools or other institutions.
   - Competitor data in the same space can also validate estimates.

3. **Pitch Deck** (Slides 15 & 16):
   - Include:
     - Market size.
     - Sustainable business model.
     - Marginal cost reduction with scale.
     - Current environment's favorability toward this business model.
     - Foundersâ€™ vision and leadership.
     - Team execution capability.
   - Remove or condense the Flywheel to one page; it's too detailed and not critical.

4. **Business Model Validation**:
   - Unverified assumptions lack persuasiveness.
   - Run the model in the market first to gather real PMF and Financial Model data.

5. **Visual Explanations**:
   - Use visuals instead of text-heavy explanations.
   - Example: A meeting screenshot between Mentor and Mentee explains the core business model better than extensive descriptions.

6. **Fundraising Preparation**:
   - Product (tested platform with at least limited promotion).
   - Pitch Deck.
   - A few hundred students onboarded to justify advertisements.
   - Brand partnerships, even minimal, show credibility.

7. **Team Introductions**:
   - Match team members to their respective roles.
