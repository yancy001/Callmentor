# Meeting Minutes - October 3rd

## Team Introduction

### Members:
- Wenyi 
- Yuesong 
- Haomin 
- Kevin 
- Yang 

### Early Role Distribution:
- **Technical Group**: Platform Development  
  - Haomin, Kaiwen
- **Business Group**: Contacting Practitioners and Recruitment Post-Launch  
  - Wenyi, Yuesong, Yang 

### Key Principles:
1. **Trust and Team Dynamic**:
   - Anyone in the team can be replaced, but what sets us apart is mutual trust and the rapport developed over time as the project grows.  
   - Trust means reliability. For instance, if someone cannot complete a task due to an emergency, the team can step in to share the responsibility.

2. **Merit Over Personal Habits**:
   - Trust within the team is earned through contributions to the project and results for platform development, not personal lifestyle habits (e.g., tidiness or social behaviors unrelated to work).

3. **No Internal Competition**:
   - Unlike large corporations, where internal competition can drive efficiency, competition in a small team like ours only drains energy. We are teammates, not rivals.

4. **Mutual Growth**:
   - While forming the team, we aim to be "benefactors" to each other, helping everyone achieve success together.
