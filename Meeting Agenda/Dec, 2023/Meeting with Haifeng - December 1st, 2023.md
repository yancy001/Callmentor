### **MVP Development**:
1. **Development Cycle**:
   - Two-person team requires about 1.5 months for MVP development.
   - Adjustments may extend the timeline by 1–2 weeks.

2. **Current Figma Designs**:
   - Sufficient for MVP usage.
   - UI optimization can be done before product launch with minimal cost (a few thousand RMB).

3. **Development Approach**:
   - **Agile Development**:
     - Use 15-day cycles for iterations and testing simultaneously.
     - Avoid completing the entire product before testing; this helps maintain team enthusiasm.
   - **Rebuild Risk**:
     - Rebuilds are acceptable in exchange for faster iteration, potentially saving time overall.

### **Funding**:
1. **Current Environment**:
   - The funding climate is tight, and investors are cautious, especially with young teams on their first entrepreneurial ventures.

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Finalize **PMF** (Product Market Fit) and **financial models** before seeking funding.
   - After the MVP is completed, attempt fundraising at low costs.
   - Avoid individual investors to reduce future complications during Series A or B funding rounds.
   - Focus on institutional investors for long-term benefits.

3. **Funding Timing**:
   - Money will follow once the product is ready. There's no need for polished Figma presentations at this stage.

4. **Market Validation**:
   - Similar business models have been validated multiple times in both China and the U.S., especially in student consulting agencies.
   - The key question is whether the market size is in the millions or tens of millions.

### **Team Collaboration**:
1. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Internal conflicts must be resolved to prevent project delays or failure.
   - Introducing new members is advisable only after resolving existing internal issues.

2. **Communication**:
   - Encourage open discussions to resolve conflicts and build trust among team members.

### **Traffic Strategy**:
1. **Multi-Platform Approach**:
   - Develop a traffic matrix across various platforms.

2. **Media Costs**:
   - Operating self-media accounts requires substantial investment.
