## Haifeng's Key Takeaways:

### **MVP Development**:
1. **Timeline**:
   - With two people, MVP development takes approximately 1.5 months.
   - Potential adjustments may extend the timeline by 1–2 weeks.

2. **Figma Usage**:
   - Current Figma designs are sufficient for MVP.
   - Figma is solely for Kevin’s code implementation.
   - UI can be optimized (for a few thousand RMB) before the product launch.

3. **Business Insights from Zaihang**:
   - **Core Services**:
     - Psychological counseling and career services account for 60% of offerings.
     - Social and consulting trends shift significantly based on annual societal trends.
   - **Promotion Strategy**:
     - Leveraged Guokr’s talent pool.
   - **Practitioner Numbers**:
     - 20,000 practitioners available; testing and financing possible with 2,000 (ratio 50:2000).
   - **Revenue Model**:
     - Mainly through commissions.
   - **Additional Services**:
     - Audio Q&A with a "steal listen for $1" model.
     - Corporate training programs with specialized instructors.

### **Development Recommendations**:
1. Agile Development:
   - Use a 15-day iteration cycle, integrating testing into the process.
   - Avoid completing the entire product before testing; it risks draining the team’s enthusiasm.

2. **Rebuild Risk**:
   - Rebuild risks are acceptable in exchange for quick iterations and potential time savings.

---

### **Funding**:
1. **Current Environment**:
   - Funding environment is tight, and investors are cautious with young first-time teams.

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Finalize PMF and financial models before seeking funding.
   - Try securing funds after the MVP is completed; costs are minimal.
   - Avoid personal investors to reduce complications during later investment rounds (Series A, Series B).
   - Institutional investors are preferred.
   - Once the product is ready, funding opportunities will come.

3. **Presentation**:
   - Having a functional product eliminates the need for Figma presentations during funding pitches.

4. **Market Validation**:
   - Similar business models have been proven viable in both China and the U.S., especially in student consulting agencies. 
   - The main question lies in whether the market size is in the millions or tens of millions.

---

### **Team Collaboration**:
1. **Conflict Management**:
   - Team conflicts must be resolved to prevent derailing the project.
   - Bringing in new members should only happen after internal conflicts are resolved to avoid further divisions.

2. **Communication**:
   - Team discussions should be open and direct. Arguments are acceptable; suspicion and avoidance are worse.

3. **Member Sensitivity**:
   - Team members tend to be sensitive. Open discussions help build trust and avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

4. **Technical Challenges**:
   - If recurring technical issues persist, consider outsourcing or introducing new technical members.

---

### **Traffic Strategy**:
1. **Multi-Platform Approach**:
   - Build a traffic matrix across platforms.
   - Explore opportunities on TikTok Live (currently 3–5 years behind China's ecosystem).

2. **Social Media Costs**:
   - Running self-media accounts requires significant costs.

---

## Key Deliverables:
1. **MVP by Late December**:
   - Payment functionality excluded.
   - Dual-platform consumer interface (web and mobile) for ease of use.
   - Practitioner interface limited to web only.

2. **Vendor Discussions**:
   - Compare timelines, completion levels, and quotes against Zaihang’s benchmarks.

---

## Final Notes:
1. **Team Collaboration**:
   - Our business model has been validated and is worth trying. However, failure due to team or technical issues would be disappointing.
   - Persistent technical conflicts may necessitate outsourcing or new technical hires.

2. **Future Planning**:
   - Secure timelines for vendors and discuss product completion levels and pricing.
